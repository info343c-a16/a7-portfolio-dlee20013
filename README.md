1. The purpose of the project is to create a simple portfolio to display past works.
2. http://students.washington.edu/davinl/info343/a7-portfolio-dlee20013
3. I did not receive any help from fellow students.
4. 20 hours or so given the sheer number of files to play around with.
5. I think the hardest challenge for me was utilizing CSS.  I honestly didn't leave enough time to actually do the CSS portion well as a portfolio should have. I will want to improve upon this edition in the future.
